The Archer's Revenge is an action-masala novel, giving you the experience of
eating a home-cooked meal. As you savour the nostalgia, and chew on the familiar
places in and around Chennai, you’ll be met with a few surprises that will make
you both laugh and cry.

In this debut novel, Destination Infinity inspires each of us that we, too, can
write—all it takes is a healthy dose of foolhardiness.

Enjoy it with your kids and the kid in you!
